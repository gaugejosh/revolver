# revolver
Battery Park City Authority repo.

## Using the Makefile
When you pull the repo, notice that it only has the template files. You'll need to install a fresh copy of WordPress to get started. I've made this super easy by opening a terminal and navigating to the repo folder. Then simply type 'make wordpress' (without the quotes) and it will install the files in their correct place.
